ometimes people use a different interpretation of probability. For example, if somebody says, "The probability that my best friend calls today is 30%," then this statement clearly cannot be interpreted as a long-run frequency because today, the particular circumstances of today happened only once. So, what this person means is there's simply a subjective feeling of 30% that this event will happen.
So, this is called a subjective probability. It's not based on experiments, and different people may assign different probabilities to the same event.
