Sometimes people use a different interpretation of probability. 
For example, if somebody says, "The probability that my best friend calls today is 30%," then this statement clearly cannot be interpreted as a long-run frequency because
today, the particular circumstances of today happened only once. So, what this person means is there's simply a subjective feeling of 30% that this event will happen.

So, this is called a subjective probability. It's not based on experiments, and different people may assign different probabilities to the same event.

Probabilities are always between 0 and 1. The key for computing probabilities is to apply a few rules repeatedly. We already saw that the probability that a newborn is a girl is 48.8%,
so, what's the probability that a newborn is a boy?Well, that's the opposite so, it's 1 - 48.8%, which is 51.2%. And that's already our first rule.

*This is the complement rule >> P(A does not occur) = 1- P(A) >> here P(0 is new born in a girl

A die has six sides and each of them is equally likely. So each side has probability 1/6 of coming up. 

* This is our second rule. It's called the rule for equally likely outcomes.
If there are N possible outcomes and they are equally likely, then the probability of an event A is the number of outcomes in A, divided by N
>>> P(A is the number of outcomes in A) / N


# Computer Prob of Multiple Events #

A and B are called mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. 
Let's look at an example. Suppose we roll a die twice. Let's call the event A, to be the event where we see one spot on the first roll, B is the event where
we see six spots on the first roll, and C is the event where we see one spot on the second roll. 

Then A and B are mutually exclusive, because if we have one spot on the first roll, then we cannot have six spots on the first roll.But A and C are not mutually exclusive
because if you have one spot on the first roll, then we can also have one spot on the second roll.* So here is our 
# third rule, it's called the addition rule. If the events A and B are mutually exclusive, then the 
>>>     P(A or B) happening = sum[P(A) + P(B) ]  

* So the last rule is the multiplication rule. It says if A and B are independent, 
>>> then the P( A and B )happening = P( A ) x P( B ).
