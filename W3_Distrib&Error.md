# DISTRIBUTIONS
About 2/3 of the data fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean. This is called the empirical rule. 
There's a second part to the empirical rule which says that about 95% of the data fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
99.7% data fallas within 3 STD of mean.
Have inituition of implying in on Histogram- bell shaped, quantile-quantile plot (QQ plot)- straight line

# Standarding
Standardizing means that we take the data, in this case, the height measurements and we subtract of the mean and divide by the standard deviation.
Z is standardized value or Z score and has no units >> Z = (value - mean) / std deviation,
After we standardize, the standardized values follow what's called the standard normal curve which has mean 0 and standard deviation 1

# Normal Approximation
